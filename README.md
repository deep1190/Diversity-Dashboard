# Diversity Analysis and Visualization
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing and visualizing HR data to assess gender-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) within a telecom company. The project aims to identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level and provide actionable recommendations to enhance diversity and inclusion.

Project Overview
Background: Our telecom client has been actively pursuing improved gender balance at the executive management level but has observed minimal progress despite sustained efforts. Recognizing the critical importance of diversity and inclusion in driving business success in a complex and heterogeneous world, PwC Switzerland has been engaged to provide analytical support and strategic recommendations to address these challenges.
